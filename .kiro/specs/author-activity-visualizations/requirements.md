# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds interactive data visualizations to the author about page, providing insights into the author's blogging activity and content distribution. The implementation includes two main visualization components: a GitHub-style activity heatmap showing weekly posting patterns, and a zoomable treemap displaying tag distribution across different content categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Activity Heatmap Visualization

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to see the author's posting activity in a visual heatmap format, so that I can understand their writing patterns and consistency over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the about page THEN the system SHALL display a GitHub-style activity heatmap showing blog post publication dates
2. WHEN the heatmap is rendered THEN it SHALL show data organized by weeks and days of the week
3. WHEN a user hovers over a heatmap cell THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip showing the exact date and number of posts published
4. WHEN there are no posts for a given day THEN the system SHALL display an empty/light colored cell
5. WHEN there are multiple posts on the same day THEN the system SHALL use color intensity to indicate the volume
6. WHEN the heatmap loads THEN it SHALL show the most recent 52 weeks of activity by default
7. WHEN the author has no posts in the timeframe THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2: Tag Distribution Treemap

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to see a visual breakdown of content topics and categories, so that I can quickly understand the author's areas of expertise and content focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the about page THEN the system SHALL display a zoomable treemap showing tag distribution
2. WHEN the treemap is rendered THEN each rectangle SHALL represent a tag with size proportional to post count
3. WHEN a user clicks on a treemap section THEN the system SHALL zoom into that category if it has sub-categories
4. WHEN a user hovers over a treemap section THEN the system SHALL display tag name and post count
5. WHEN tags have hierarchical relationships THEN the system SHALL group them appropriately in the treemap
6. WHEN a user clicks on a tag section THEN the system SHALL optionally navigate to the tag's blog listing page
7. WHEN the treemap loads THEN it SHALL use a color scheme that matches the site's theme (light/dark mode)

### Requirement 3: Responsive Design and Performance

**User Story:** As a blog visitor on any device, I want the visualizations to load quickly and display properly, so that I can access the information regardless of my screen size or connection speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualizations load THEN they SHALL be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the visualizations SHALL remain interactive and readable
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the visualization data SHALL be computed at build time for optimal performance
4. WHEN the visualizations render THEN they SHALL support both light and dark themes
5. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL display fallback content or gracefully degrade

### Requirement 4: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to configure the visualization settings, so that I can customize the appearance and behavior to match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the site THEN the administrator SHALL be able to enable/disable each visualization independently
2. WHEN configuring the heatmap THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set the time range (weeks to display)
3. WHEN configuring the treemap THEN the administrator SHALL be able to define tag hierarchies and groupings
4. WHEN configuring colors THEN the administrator SHALL be able to customize the color schemes for both visualizations
5. WHEN the author has multiple blogs/categories THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by content type

### Requirement 5: Data Integration and Processing

**User Story:** As a system, I need to efficiently process blog post data to generate visualization datasets, so that the visualizations can render quickly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site builds THEN the system SHALL extract publication dates from all blog posts
2. WHEN processing tags THEN the system SHALL aggregate tag usage counts across all posts
3. WHEN generating heatmap data THEN the system SHALL group posts by publication date
4. WHEN generating treemap data THEN the system SHALL calculate tag frequencies and hierarchies
5. WHEN an author has no posts THEN the system SHALL handle empty datasets gracefully
6. WHEN blog posts are updated THEN the visualization data SHALL be regenerated during the next build

### Requirement 6: Third-party Integration Options

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want the option to integrate with external activity tracking services, so that I can display more comprehensive activity data beyond just blog posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL optionally integrate with GitHub API for commit activity
2. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to local blog data only
3. WHEN using external APIs THEN the system SHALL cache responses to avoid rate limiting
4. WHEN external data is included THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data sources in the visualization
5. IF external integration is enabled THEN the administrator SHALL be able to configure API keys and endpoints
