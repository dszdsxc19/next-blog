# Blog Table of Contents (TOC) Feature Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an automatic, modern Table of Contents (TOC) feature for blog posts. The current blog template has TOC data extraction capabilities through the `pliny` library, but lacks automatic TOC display and modern styling that matches the overall design aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic TOC Display

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to see a table of contents automatically displayed for long articles, so that I can quickly navigate to sections of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post has 3 or more headings (H2-H6) THEN the system SHALL automatically display a TOC
2. WHEN a blog post has fewer than 3 headings THEN the system SHALL NOT display a TOC
3. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL show all heading levels from H2 to H6
4. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned consistently across all layout types (PostLayout, PostSimple, PostBanner)
5. WHEN a user clicks on a TOC link THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the corresponding heading

### Requirement 2: Modern Visual Design

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want the TOC to have a modern, visually appealing design that matches the blog's aesthetic, so that it enhances rather than detracts from the reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL use a modern card-based design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
2. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL support both light and dark themes seamlessly
3. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate typography hierarchy with different font sizes for different heading levels
4. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL include subtle hover effects and active states
5. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL use the blog's existing color palette and design tokens

### Requirement 3: Responsive Behavior

**User Story:** As a blog reader on different devices, I want the TOC to adapt appropriately to my screen size, so that it provides optimal usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop (xl screens) THEN the TOC SHALL be positioned as a sticky sidebar element
2. WHEN viewed on tablet (md-lg screens) THEN the TOC SHALL be positioned at the top of the content area
3. WHEN viewed on mobile (sm screens and below) THEN the TOC SHALL be collapsible with a toggle button
4. WHEN the TOC is sticky on desktop THEN it SHALL remain visible during scrolling within appropriate boundaries
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the TOC SHALL adapt its layout responsively

### Requirement 4: Smart Positioning and Layout Integration

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want the TOC to be positioned logically within the page layout, so that it doesn't interfere with the main content while remaining easily accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PostLayout THEN the TOC SHALL be positioned in the left sidebar area on desktop
2. WHEN using PostSimple THEN the TOC SHALL be positioned at the top of the content on all screen sizes
3. WHEN using PostBanner THEN the TOC SHALL be positioned after the banner image but before the content
4. WHEN the TOC is sticky THEN it SHALL respect the header height and footer boundaries
5. WHEN the TOC is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT overlap with other UI elements

### Requirement 5: Active Section Highlighting

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to see which section I'm currently reading highlighted in the TOC, so that I can maintain context of my position within the article.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through the article THEN the TOC SHALL highlight the currently visible section
2. WHEN multiple headings are visible THEN the TOC SHALL highlight the topmost visible heading
3. WHEN a heading becomes visible THEN the TOC SHALL update the active state with smooth transitions
4. WHEN the active section changes THEN the TOC SHALL provide visual feedback through color and/or styling changes
5. WHEN the TOC is scrollable THEN it SHALL auto-scroll to keep the active item visible

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a blog reader with accessibility needs, I want the TOC to be fully accessible and performant, so that I can navigate the content effectively regardless of my abilities or device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all TOC links SHALL be focusable and navigable
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the TOC SHALL be properly labeled and structured
3. WHEN the TOC is rendered THEN it SHALL NOT negatively impact page load performance
4. WHEN the TOC includes scroll spy functionality THEN it SHALL use efficient event handling
5. WHEN the TOC is interactive THEN it SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a blog administrator, I want to configure TOC behavior and appearance, so that I can customize it to match my blog's specific needs and branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the blog THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling automatic TOC display
2. WHEN configuring the blog THEN the system SHALL allow setting minimum heading count threshold
3. WHEN configuring the blog THEN the system SHALL allow customizing which heading levels to include
4. WHEN configuring the blog THEN the system SHALL allow per-post TOC override through frontmatter
5. WHEN a post has `toc: false` in frontmatter THEN the system SHALL NOT display the TOC regardless of heading count

### Requirement 8: Smooth Animations and Interactions

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want smooth, polished animations when interacting with the TOC, so that the experience feels modern and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking a TOC link THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scroll animation to the target heading
2. WHEN the active section changes THEN the TOC SHALL animate the highlight transition
3. WHEN collapsing/expanding the mobile TOC THEN the system SHALL provide smooth height transitions
4. WHEN hovering over TOC items THEN the system SHALL provide subtle hover animations
5. WHEN animations are disabled by user preference THEN the system SHALL respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
