# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Table of Contents (TOC) display behavior in blog post layouts with intelligent scroll-based visibility. The TOC will dynamically show/hide based on the user's scroll position, creating a more refined reading experience by only displaying the TOC when the navigation link ("Back to the blog") is out of view.

The enhancement maintains the existing TOC functionality while adding a sophisticated visibility control mechanism that responds to scroll events, ensuring the TOC appears at the right moment and doesn't interfere with the initial reading experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Initial TOC Hidden State

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the TOC to be hidden when I first load a blog post, so that I can focus on the content without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post page loads THEN the TOC SHALL be hidden from view
2. WHEN the page is at the top position THEN the "Back to the blog" link SHALL be visible
3. WHEN the TOC is hidden THEN it SHALL not occupy visual space in the layout
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the TOC container SHALL exist in the DOM but be visually hidden

### Requirement 2: TOC Visibility Trigger on Scroll Down

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the TOC to appear automatically when I scroll past the navigation link, so that I can access the table of contents without scrolling back up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls down AND the "Back to the blog" link reaches the top of the viewport THEN the TOC SHALL become visible
2. WHEN the TOC becomes visible THEN it SHALL apply sticky positioning
3. WHEN the TOC is sticky THEN it SHALL remain fixed at the top of its container as the user continues scrolling
4. WHEN the TOC appears THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not jarring
5. WHEN the TOC is visible and sticky THEN it SHALL not scroll out of view when scrolling down

### Requirement 3: TOC Hide Behavior on Scroll Up

**User Story:** As a reader, I want the TOC to hide when I scroll back to the top, so that the navigation link is accessible and the layout returns to its initial state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls up AND the "Back to the blog" link enters the viewport THEN the TOC SHALL lose its sticky positioning
2. WHEN the TOC loses sticky positioning THEN it SHALL scroll naturally with the page content
3. WHEN the "Back to the blog" link is fully visible in the viewport THEN the TOC SHALL be hidden
4. WHEN scrolling to the very top of the page THEN the TOC SHALL be completely hidden
5. WHEN the TOC transitions from sticky to hidden THEN the animation SHALL be smooth

### Requirement 4: Scroll Position Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accurate scroll position detection, so that the TOC visibility changes occur at the correct moments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing scroll detection THEN the system SHALL use Intersection Observer API for performance
2. WHEN the "Back to the blog" link is the observation target THEN its visibility state SHALL be accurately tracked
3. WHEN scroll events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without performance degradation
4. WHEN the page is resized THEN the scroll detection SHALL continue to work correctly
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all scroll listeners and observers SHALL be cleaned up

### Requirement 5: Maintain Existing TOC Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing TOC features to continue working, so that the enhancement doesn't break current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TOC is visible THEN all existing TOC features (active heading highlighting, click navigation, etc.) SHALL work as before
2. WHEN the TOC configuration is set to hide TOC THEN the scroll-based visibility SHALL not apply
3. WHEN there are insufficient headings for TOC display THEN the scroll-based visibility SHALL not apply
4. WHEN the TOC is visible THEN it SHALL maintain its current styling and layout
5. WHEN using the TOC links THEN navigation to headings SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 6: Responsive Behavior

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the TOC scroll behavior to work appropriately on my device, so that I have a good reading experience regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices (< 768px) THEN the scroll-based visibility SHALL work appropriately for the viewport size
2. WHEN viewing on tablet devices (768px - 1024px) THEN the scroll-based visibility SHALL work appropriately
3. WHEN viewing on desktop devices (> 1024px) THEN the scroll-based visibility SHALL work as designed
4. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the scroll detection SHALL recalculate positions correctly
5. WHEN on smaller screens THEN the TOC SHALL not overlap with content

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the TOC visibility changes to be accessible and performant, so that I can use the feature effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TOC visibility changes THEN screen readers SHALL be notified appropriately
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the TOC visibility SHALL not interfere with focus management
3. WHEN the user has reduced motion preferences THEN transitions SHALL be minimal or disabled
4. WHEN scroll events occur THEN the performance impact SHALL be negligible (< 16ms per frame)
5. WHEN the TOC state changes THEN ARIA attributes SHALL be updated appropriately

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the implementation to be clean and maintainable, so that future modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the code SHALL follow existing project patterns and conventions
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN it SHALL be modular and reusable
3. WHEN modifying existing components THEN changes SHALL be minimal and focused
4. WHEN adding scroll logic THEN it SHALL be separated into a custom hook for reusability
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN TypeScript types SHALL be properly defined
6. WHEN styling is added THEN it SHALL use Tailwind CSS utilities consistently with the existing codebase
