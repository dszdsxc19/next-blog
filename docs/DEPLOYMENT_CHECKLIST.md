## Build Process Verification

### 1. Clean Build Test

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf .next
rm -rf .contentlayer

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run build
pnpm build
```

### 2. Verify Generated Files

Check that these files are created during build:

- [ ] `public/activity-data.json`
- [ ] `public/tag-data.json`
- [ ] `public/visualization-stats.json`

### 3. Bundle Size Check

```bash
# Analyze bundle size
pnpm analyze
```

Verify that visualization libraries are properly code-split.

### 4. TypeScript Check

```bash
# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Runtime Testing

### 1. Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Scenarios

- [ ] Visit author page with visualizations enabled
- [ ] Test with no blog posts (empty state)
- [ ] Test with many blog posts (performance)
- [ ] Test theme switching (light/dark)
- [ ] Test responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [ ] Test accessibility features
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network issues, invalid data)

### 3. Browser Compatibility

Test in:

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables

Set production environment variables:

```bash
# Optional GitHub integration
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token (if needed)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_INTEGRATION=false

# Visualization settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEATMAP_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREEMAP_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. Build Optimization

- [ ] Enable production optimizations
- [ ] Verify CSP headers allow visualization libraries
- [ ] Check that static files are served correctly

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor bundle size impact
- [ ] Track loading performance
- [ ] Monitor user interactions

## Post-deployment Verification

### 1. Functionality Check

- [ ] Visualizations load correctly
- [ ] Data is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Interactive features work
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### 2. Performance Check

- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Visualizations don't block page rendering
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No console errors

### 3. Accessibility Check

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast
- [ ] Text alternatives

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

### 1. Quick Disable

Disable visualizations via feature flags:

```javascript
// In siteMetadata.js
visualizations: {
  heatmap: { enabled: false },
  treemap: { enabled: false }
}
```

### 2. Environment Variable Override

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEATMAP_ENABLED=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREEMAP_ENABLED=false
```

### 3. Component Removal

Comment out visualization components in AuthorLayout:

```jsx
{
  /* <ActivityVisualizationsContainer /> */
}
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Checks

- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check data accuracy
- [ ] Verify performance metrics
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly

### 2. User Feedback

- [ ] Collect user feedback on visualizations
- [ ] Monitor accessibility issues
- [ ] Track usage analytics

### 3. Updates and Improvements

- [ ] Plan regular feature updates
- [ ] Monitor library updates
- [ ] Optimize based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Visualizations Not Loading

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify data files exist in public directory
3. Check network requests for failed loads
4. Verify configuration is correct

### Performance Issues

1. Check bundle size impact
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Verify lazy loading is working
4. Check for memory leaks

### Accessibility Issues

1. Test with screen readers
2. Verify keyboard navigation
3. Check color contrast ratios
4. Test with accessibility tools

### Data Issues

1. Verify blog post frontmatter
2. Check date formats
3. Verify tag data
4. Check build process logs

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- [ ] All visualizations load without errors
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] User experience is smooth
